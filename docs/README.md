## Document Organization Philosophy

This documentation structure follows industry best practices with clear separation of concerns:

### User-Focused Documentation (`user_guide/`)
Practical guides for end users, including tutorials, examples, and getting started materials.

### Developer Documentation (`developer_guide/`)
Technical development information for contributors, including testing, setup, and implementation guidance.

### Reference Material (`reference/`)
Comprehensive technical specifications, architecture documentation, and API references for detailed technical understanding.

### Project Management (`project/`)
Strategic documents, planning materials, and development tracking for stakeholders and project coordination.

### Issue Management (`issues/`)
Structured bug tracking and issue resolution with proper categorization and documentation.

### Implementation Details (`implementation/`)
Specific implementation plans, migration strategies, and detailed technical solutions.

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:
- Place user-focused content in `user_guide/`
- Place developer information in `developer_guide/`
- Place technical specifications in `reference/`
- Place strategic content in `project/`
- Place bug reports in `issues/`
- Place implementation details in `implementation/`
- Always update relevant README files with new document links
- Follow existing naming conventions and organization patterns

## Navigation Tips

- Each major section has its own README with detailed navigation
- Related documents are cross-referenced for easy discovery  
- Status information is maintained for active development items
- Historical documents are preserved in appropriate subdirectories
