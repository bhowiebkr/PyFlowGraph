# Implementation Notes

Technical implementation priorities and considerations for PyFlowGraph development.

## Critical Implementation Gaps

### Table Stakes Features
Every competitor has these - PyFlowGraph must implement to be viable:

1. **Undo/Redo System** - Multi-level undo/redo with Command Pattern
2. **Node Grouping/Containers** - Collapsible subgraphs for complexity management

### Performance Opportunities

**Shared Subprocess Execution Model**
- Current: Isolated subprocess per node
- Target: Shared Python process with direct object passing
- Expected gain: 10-100x performance improvement
- Implementation: Replace serialization overhead with memory sharing
- Security: Maintain through sandboxing options

### Differentiation Opportunities

**Python-Native Debugging**
- Syntax-highlighted logs (remove emoji output)
- Breakpoints and step-through execution
- Native pdb integration
- Live data inspection at nodes
- This would set PyFlowGraph apart from competitors

### Quick Implementation Wins

**Pin Type Visibility**
- Type badges/labels on pins (Unity Visual Scripting style)
- Hover tooltips with full type information
- Connection compatibility highlighting during drag
- Color + shape coding for accessibility
- Relatively easy to implement, high user value

**Search Features**
- Node search palette (Ctrl+Space or Tab)
- Quick node creation from connection drag
- Context-sensitive node suggestions
- Standard in most node editors, essential for usability

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Critical Path**: Undo/Redo → Node Grouping → Performance Model
2. **Parallel Development**: Pin visibility improvements, search features
3. **Differentiation**: Python debugging capabilities
4. **Foundation**: Proper type system and validation

## Technical Debt Areas

- Pin direction categorization bug (affects markdown loading)
- GUI rendering inconsistencies
- Connection validation system
- Execution flow coordination

## Architecture Considerations

- Command Pattern for undo/redo system
- Observer pattern for live data visualization
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Type system redesign for better validation
