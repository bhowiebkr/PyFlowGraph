# Project Brief: PyFlowGraph Priority 1 Features Implementation

## Executive Summary

This project implements two critical feature gaps in PyFlowGraph that are considered "table stakes" in the node editor market: a comprehensive Undo/Redo system and Node Grouping/Container functionality. These features directly address the most significant competitive disadvantages identified in market analysis and are essential for PyFlowGraph to be considered a professional-grade tool.

## Project Overview

### Project Name
PyFlowGraph Feature Parity Initiative - Phase 1

### Duration
Estimated 6-8 weeks for full implementation

### Priority
Critical - These features are blockers for professional adoption

### Impact
- **User Productivity**: 40-60% reduction in error recovery time
- **Graph Complexity**: Enable 5-10x larger graphs through grouping
- **Market Competitiveness**: Move from "interesting prototype" to "viable tool"

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
PyFlowGraph currently lacks two fundamental features that every professional node editor provides:
1. **No Undo/Redo**: Users cannot recover from mistakes without manual reconstruction
2. **No Node Grouping**: Complex graphs become unmanageable without abstraction layers

### Market Analysis
- **100% of competitors** have both features
- User feedback consistently cites these as deal-breakers
- Professional users expect these as baseline functionality

### Success Metrics
- Zero user complaints about missing undo/redo
- Ability to manage graphs with 200+ nodes effectively
- 50% reduction in reported user errors
- Positive user feedback on workflow improvements

## Feature 1: Undo/Redo System

### Scope Definition

#### In Scope
- Multi-level undo/redo (minimum 50 steps)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y/Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- Menu integration with history display
- Undo/redo for all graph operations:
  - Node creation/deletion
  - Connection creation/deletion
  - Node movement/resizing
  - Property changes
  - Code modifications
  - Copy/paste operations
  - Group/ungroup operations

#### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Cross-session undo persistence
- Branching undo trees
- Undo for file operations

### Technical Requirements

#### Architecture Pattern
Implement Command Pattern with the following structure:

```python
class Command(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self): pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def undo(self): pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_description(self): str

class CommandHistory:
    def __init__(self, max_size=50):
        self.history = []
        self.current_index = -1
        self.max_size = max_size
```

#### Integration Points
1. **node_graph.py**: Wrap all graph modifications in commands
2. **node_editor_view.py**: Handle keyboard shortcuts
3. **node_editor_window.py**: Add menu items and toolbar buttons
4. **node.py**: Track property changes
5. **connection.py**: Track connection changes

#### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)**
- Create command base classes
- Implement CommandHistory manager
- Add undo/redo stack to NodeGraph

**Phase 2: Basic Commands (Week 2)**
- CreateNodeCommand
- DeleteNodeCommand
- MoveNodeCommand
- CreateConnectionCommand
- DeleteConnectionCommand

**Phase 3: Complex Commands (Week 3)**
- CompositeCommand for multi-operations
- PropertyChangeCommand
- CodeModificationCommand
- CopyPasteCommand

**Phase 4: UI Integration (Week 4)**
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Menu items with descriptions
- Toolbar buttons
- Visual feedback

### User Experience Design

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo last action
- **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z**: Redo
- **Alt+Backspace**: Alternative undo (for accessibility)

#### Menu Structure
```
Edit Menu
├── Undo [Action Name]  Ctrl+Z
├── Redo [Action Name]  Ctrl+Y
├── ─────────────────────────
├── Undo History...
└── Clear History
```

#### Visual Feedback
- Show action description in status bar
- Temporary highlight of affected elements
- Disable undo/redo buttons when not available

## Feature 2: Node Grouping/Containers

### Scope Definition

#### In Scope
- Collapse selected nodes into a single group node
- Expand groups back to constituent nodes
- Nested groups (groups within groups)
- Custom I/O pins for groups
- Visual representation as single node
- Save groups as reusable templates
- Load group templates into any graph

#### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Cross-project group libraries
- Online group sharing
- Auto-grouping suggestions
- Group versioning

### Technical Requirements

#### Data Model Extensions

```python
class NodeGroup(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.internal_graph = NodeGraph()
        self.input_mappings = {}  # External pin -> internal node.pin
        self.output_mappings = {} # Internal node.pin -> external pin
        self.collapsed = True
        self.group_color = QColor()
        
class GroupTemplate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = ""
        self.description = ""
        self.internal_graph_data = {}
        self.interface_definition = {}
```

#### Core Functionality

**Group Creation Process:**
1. Select nodes to group
2. Analyze external connections
3. Create interface pins automatically
4. Generate group node
5. Reroute external connections
6. Hide internal nodes

**Group Expansion Process:**
1. Restore internal nodes to scene
2. Restore internal connections
3. Reroute external connections
4. Remove group node
5. Maintain positioning

#### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Basic Grouping (Week 1-2)**
- Implement NodeGroup class
- Selection to group conversion
- Basic collapse/expand
- Pin interface generation

**Phase 2: Visual Representation (Week 3)**
- Custom group node painting
- Nested view navigation
- Breadcrumb UI for hierarchy
- Group color coding

**Phase 3: Templates (Week 4)**
- Save group as template
- Load template system
- Template management dialog
- Template metadata

**Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 5)**
- Nested groups support
- Group property dialog
- Custom pin configuration
- Group documentation

### User Experience Design

#### Creation Workflow
1. **Select nodes** (Ctrl+Click or drag selection)
2. **Right-click** → "Group Selected" or **Ctrl+G**
3. **Name dialog** appears
4. **Group created** with auto-generated interface

#### Interaction Patterns
- **Double-click**: Enter/exit group
- **Right-click**: Group context menu
- **Alt+Click**: Quick expand/collapse
- **Ctrl+Shift+G**: Ungroup

#### Visual Design
```
Collapsed Group:
┌─────────────────┐
│ 📦 Group Name   │
├─────────────────┤
│ ● Input 1       │
│ ● Input 2       │
│        Output ● │
└─────────────────┘

Expanded View:
Shows internal nodes with breadcrumb:
[Main Graph] > [Group Name] > [Nested Group]
```

## Technical Architecture Impact

### File Format Changes

The Markdown flow format needs extension for groups:

```markdown
## Group: Data Processing
<!--group-metadata
collapsed: true
color: "#4A90E2"
position: [100, 200]
interface:
  inputs: [{name: "data", type: "list"}]
  outputs: [{name: "result", type: "dict"}]
-->

### Internal Nodes
[Internal graph structure here]

## End Group
```

### Performance Considerations

- Groups reduce scene complexity when collapsed
- Lazy evaluation of hidden nodes
- Cache group execution results
- Memory overhead for group metadata (~1KB per group)

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- Command execution and undo
- History management
- Group creation/destruction
- Template save/load
- Nested group operations

#### Integration Tests
- Undo/redo with groups
- Copy/paste of groups
- File save/load with groups
- Execution of grouped nodes

#### Performance Tests
- Undo history with 1000+ operations
- Groups with 100+ internal nodes
- Deeply nested groups (10+ levels)

## Implementation Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Serialization Complexity
**Risk**: Command serialization for complex operations
**Mitigation**: Start with memory-only undo, add persistence later

### Risk 2: Group Execution Order
**Risk**: Groups may break execution dependency resolution
**Mitigation**: Maintain flat execution graph internally

### Risk 3: UI Complexity
**Risk**: Nested navigation may confuse users
**Mitigation**: Clear breadcrumbs and visual hierarchy

### Risk 4: Backward Compatibility
**Risk**: File format changes break existing graphs
**Mitigation**: Version field in files, migration code
