# Epic 3.4: Pin Type Visibility Enhancement

## Status
**Ready for Planning** - Epic defined, child stories ready for sprint assignment

## Epic Statement

**As a** PyFlowGraph user,  
**I want** to easily identify pin data types and connection compatibility through hover tooltips and visual feedback,  
**so that** I can create valid connections efficiently and understand data flow without memorizing color codes.

## Business Value

### Problem Statement
Users struggle to identify pin types in PyFlowGraph, relying solely on color coding which:
- Requires memorization of color-to-type mapping
- Provides no contextual information about current values
- Creates friction for new users learning the system
- Makes debugging type mismatches time-consuming

### Success Metrics
- **User Onboarding**: New users understand pin types within 5 minutes (vs current 20+ minutes)
- **Support Reduction**: 50% fewer type-related user questions
- **Productivity**: 30% faster connection creation with reduced trial-and-error
- **Industry Alignment**: Match UX patterns from Grasshopper, Dynamo, n8n

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (Definition of Done)
1. **Pin Information**: All pins show comprehensive type information on hover
2. **Industry Standards**: Hover tooltip behavior matches Grasshopper/Dynamo patterns
3. **Performance**: Zero measurable performance impact on graph interaction
4. **Visual Integration**: Seamless integration with existing color coding system
5. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Should Have  
6. **Connection Feedback**: Connection lines show data flow information on hover
7. **Visual Effects**: Subtle hover effects enhance interaction clarity
8. **Value Display**: Current pin values visible in tooltips for debugging

### Could Have
9. **Compatibility Indicators**: Visual feedback during connection creation shows compatibility
10. **Compact Labels**: Optional persistent type labels for power users

## Child Stories

### Story 3.4.1: Basic Pin Hover Tooltips *(4 Story Points)*
**Priority**: Must Have  
**Sprint**: Next Available  
Implementation of core tooltip functionality for all pin types.

### Story 3.4.2: Pin Value Display *(3 Story Points)*  
**Priority**: Should Have  
**Sprint**: After 3.4.1  
Display current values in tooltips for data pins.

### Story 3.4.3: Hover Visual Effects *(2 Story Points)*
**Priority**: Should Have  
**Sprint**: After 3.4.1  
Add subtle glow and brightness effects on pin hover.

### Story 3.4.4: Connection Information Tooltips *(3 Story Points)*
**Priority**: Should Have  
**Sprint**: After 3.4.1  
Show connection data flow info on connection hover.

### Story 3.4.5: Type Compatibility Indicators *(5 Story Points)*
**Priority**: Could Have  
**Sprint**: Future  
Visual feedback during connection creation for compatibility.

## Technical Scope

### In Scope
- Pin hover event handling in `src/core/pin.py`
- Connection hover functionality in `src/core/connection.py` 
- Tooltip formatting utilities
- Qt native tooltip system integration
- Hover visual effects using Qt animations

### Out of Scope
- Persistent type labels (separate epic)
- Pin type color scheme changes (working system)
- New tooltip rendering system (use Qt native)
- Mobile/touch device hover alternatives

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- ✅ Existing pin color system (no changes required)
- ✅ Qt hover event infrastructure (already implemented)
- ✅ Pin type information system (already available)

### Story Dependencies
- **Blocker**: None - can start immediately
- **Sequential**: Stories 3.4.2-3.4.4 depend on 3.4.1 completion
- **Parallel**: Stories 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 can be developed simultaneously

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk ⚠️
*None identified*

### Medium Risk ⚠️  
- **Performance Impact**: Tooltip generation on every hover
  - **Mitigation**: Cache tooltip strings, lazy generation
- **Visual Conflicts**: Overlap with existing hover behaviors  
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with context menus

### Low Risk ⚠️
- **User Adoption**: Users may not discover hover feature
  - **Mitigation**: Include in onboarding tour/documentation

## Definition of Ready (Child Stories)

Before sprint assignment, each child story must have:
- [ ] Detailed acceptance criteria with testable outcomes
- [ ] Technical approach documented
- [ ] UI/UX mockups for visual changes
- [ ] Testing strategy defined
- [ ] Story point estimation completed

## Definition of Done (Epic)

Epic complete when:
- [ ] All "Must Have" acceptance criteria delivered
- [ ] User testing confirms improved type understanding
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no degradation
- [ ] Documentation updated with new tooltip features
- [ ] Regression testing passes on existing functionality

## Rollback Plan

If major issues discovered:
1. **Phase 1**: Disable hover tooltips via feature flag
2. **Phase 2**: Revert visual effects while keeping basic tooltips
3. **Phase 3**: Complete rollback to current state if necessary

All changes isolated to hover event handlers - minimal rollback complexity.
