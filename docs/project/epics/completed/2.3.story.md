# Story 2.3: Copy/Paste and Multi-Operation Undo

## Story Description

**As a** user, **I want** to undo copy/paste operations and complex multi-step actions, **so that** I can quickly revert bulk changes to my graph.

### Context
Building on the command infrastructure from Epic 1 and code modification undo from Story 2.2, this story implements composite command handling for complex operations that involve multiple steps. This enables users to treat multi-node operations and copy/paste workflows as single undoable units, providing a more intuitive undo experience for bulk graph modifications.

### Background
The foundation command pattern infrastructure has been established in Epic 1 (Stories 1.1-1.4) and Story 2.2 demonstrated successful integration for code modifications. This story extends the system to handle complex multi-step operations that should be grouped as single undo units, addressing common user workflows like copying multiple nodes, deleting selections, and batch operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: CompositeCommand Multi-Operation Handling
**Given** multiple graph operations need to be performed as a single logical unit  
**When** user performs complex operations (copy/paste, delete multiple, move multiple)  
**Then** operations are grouped using CompositeCommand as single undo unit

### AC2: Copy/Paste Command Integration  
**Given** user copies and pastes nodes  
**When** paste operation is performed  
**Then** paste creates grouped commands for all created nodes and connections

### AC3: Selection-Based Operation Grouping
**Given** multiple nodes are selected for bulk operations  
**When** user performs delete multiple or move multiple operations  
**Then** operations are automatically grouped as single undo unit

### AC4: Meaningful Operation Descriptions
**Given** composite operations are performed  
**When** user views undo history  
**Then** undo descriptions show meaningful summaries (e.g., "Delete 3 nodes", "Paste 2 nodes")

### AC5: Partial Failure Handling
**Given** composite operations where individual commands may fail  
**When** one command in the composite fails  
**Then** composite operations can be partially undone with proper rollback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 2.2 (Code Modification Undo):
- Command pattern integration is straightforward when building on existing infrastructure
- Leveraging existing infrastructure (like CodeChangeCommand) is preferred over creating new components
- PySide6 component mocking requires careful setup - consider using QTest framework for testing
- Windows platform requires careful attention to encoding (no Unicode characters in any code or tests)

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Command Infrastructure Location
- **CompositeCommand**: Already exists in `src/commands/command_base.py`
- **Node Commands**: Existing infrastructure in `src/commands/node_commands.py` (CreateNodeCommand, DeleteNodeCommand, etc.)
- **Integration Point**: NodeGraph class in `src/core/node_graph.py` for command execution
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#code-editing, docs/stories/2.2.story.md#implementation-deviations]

#### Copy/Paste Integration Points
- **Existing Methods**: `copy_selected()` and `paste()` methods in `src/core/node_graph.py` (lines 162-209+)
- **Data Format**: Uses FlowFormatHandler for markdown clipboard format with JSON fallback
- **Position Handling**: Paste position calculated from viewport center
- **Connection Preservation**: Existing logic preserves internal connections between copied nodes
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#graph-management]

#### File Locations & Structure  
- **Command Files**: `src/commands/command_base.py`, `src/commands/node_commands.py`
- **Graph Operations**: `src/core/node_graph.py` (QGraphicsScene management)
- **Test Files**: `tests/test_command_system.py`, `tests/test_composite_commands.py` (new)
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#command-pattern]

#### Data Models and Structures
- **CompositeCommand**: Takes list of CommandBase instances in constructor
- **Node Serialization**: Existing `node.serialize()` method provides full state preservation
- **Connection Data**: Connection objects have `serialize()` method for state preservation
- **UUID Management**: Nodes use UUID for consistent identification across operations
[Source: src/commands/command_base.py, src/core/node_graph.py]

#### Performance Considerations
- Individual undo/redo operations must complete within 100ms (NFR1)
- Bulk operations within 500ms (NFR1)
- CompositeCommand execution should batch sub-operations efficiently
- Memory usage for command history must not exceed 50MB (NFR3)
[Source: docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements]

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for core functionality with fast execution (<5 seconds total)
- Integration tests for component interaction 
- GUI tests for user workflows using existing test runner
- Test files mirror source structure naming convention
- Focus on edge cases: empty selections, failed operations, large composite commands
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

#### Technical Constraints
- **Windows Platform**: Use Windows-compatible commands only, no Unicode characters
- **PySide6 Framework**: Leverage Qt's built-in features for selection and clipboard
- **Command Pattern**: Follow established patterns from existing command infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with meaningful user feedback
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#prohibited-practices]

### Testing

#### Test File Locations
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/` directory with fast execution (<5 seconds per file)
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing  
- **GUI Tests**: User workflow testing using existing test runner at `src/test_runner_gui.py`
- **Test Naming**: `test_{behavior}_when_{condition}` pattern
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

#### Testing Framework and Patterns
- **Framework**: Python unittest (established pattern)
- **Test Runner**: Custom PySide6 GUI test runner for interactive testing
- **Mocking**: Be careful with PySide6 component mocking - consider QTest framework
- **Coverage**: Focus on critical paths, edge cases, and error conditions
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-framework, docs/stories/2.2.story.md#lessons-learned]

#### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test CompositeCommand with various sub-command combinations
- Test copy/paste operations with different node types and connection patterns
- Test bulk operations (delete/move multiple) with various selection sizes
- Test failure scenarios and rollback behavior
- Test memory usage with large composite operations
- Test undo description generation for meaningful user feedback
