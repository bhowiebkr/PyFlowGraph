# Story 2.4: Undo History UI and Menu Integration

## Story Description

**As a** user, **I want** visual undo/redo controls and history viewing, **so that** I can see what operations are available to undo and choose specific points to revert to.

### Context
Building on the complete command infrastructure from Epic 1 and the extended undo/redo capabilities from Stories 2.2-2.3, this story implements the final UI integration pieces. This provides users with intuitive visual controls and comprehensive history viewing, completing the professional undo/redo experience for PyFlowGraph.

### Background
The command pattern infrastructure has been fully established and proven through Epic 1 (Stories 1.1-1.4) and successfully extended for code modifications (2.2) and composite operations (2.3). Basic undo/redo menu actions already exist but need enhancement with dynamic descriptions, proper state management, toolbar integration, and a comprehensive history dialog for power users.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Enhanced Edit Menu with Dynamic Descriptions
**Given** the Edit menu contains undo/redo options  
**When** user opens the Edit menu  
**Then** undo/redo items show current operation descriptions (e.g., "Undo Delete Node", "Redo Paste 3 nodes") and are properly enabled/disabled

### AC2: Toolbar Undo/Redo Buttons
**Given** user wants quick access to undo/redo functionality  
**When** toolbar is displayed  
**Then** undo/redo buttons are available with appropriate Font Awesome icons and tooltips showing operation descriptions

### AC3: Undo History Dialog
**Given** user wants to see complete operation history  
**When** user accesses undo history (via menu or keyboard shortcut)  
**Then** dialog displays chronological list of operations with descriptions, timestamps, and ability to jump to specific points

### AC4: Status Bar Operation Feedback
**Given** user performs undo/redo operations  
**When** operations are executed  
**Then** status bar shows confirmation messages with operation details (e.g., "Undone: Delete Node", "Redone: Paste 3 nodes")

### AC5: Proper Disabled State Handling
**Given** no operations are available to undo or redo  
**When** UI elements are displayed  
**Then** undo/redo controls are properly disabled with appropriate visual feedback and tooltips explaining unavailability

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Existing UI Infrastructure
- **Main Window**: NodeEditorWindow class in `src/ui/editor/node_editor_window.py` (lines 31-350+)
- **Existing Actions**: action_undo and action_redo already implemented (lines 129-135)
- **Menu Integration**: Edit menu already contains undo/redo actions (lines 167-174)
- **Signal Connections**: Command system signals already connected (lines 290-294)
- **Status Bar**: Basic status bar feedback already implemented (lines 296-329)
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#user-interface, src/ui/editor/node_editor_window.py]

#### Command System Integration Points
- **Command History**: CommandHistory class in `src/commands/command_history.py` provides access to operations
- **NodeGraph Integration**: NodeGraph.command_history provides access to command operations
- **Existing Signals**: commandExecuted, commandUndone, commandRedone already implemented
- **State Methods**: can_undo(), can_redo(), get_undo_description(), get_redo_description() available
[Source: docs/stories/2.3.story.md#technical-implementation-details, src/commands/command_history.py]

#### File Locations & Structure
- **Main Window**: `src/ui/editor/node_editor_window.py` - Add toolbar buttons and history dialog
- **New Dialog**: `src/ui/dialogs/undo_history_dialog.py` - Create new dialog component
- **UI Utils**: `src/ui/utils/ui_utils.py` - Font Awesome icon creation patterns
- **Test Files**: `tests/test_undo_ui_integration.py` (new), existing command tests to extend
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#user-interface]

#### Font Awesome Icon Integration
- **Icon Files**: `src/resources/Font Awesome 6 Free-*.otf` embedded fonts
- **Icon Creation**: `create_fa_icon()` function in `src/ui/utils/ui_utils.py`
- **Undo Icon**: `\uf0e2` (lightgreen color used in existing action)
- **Redo Icon**: `\uf01e` (lightgreen color used in existing action)
- **History Icon**: `\uf1da` or `\uf017` for history dialog
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#font-resources, src/ui/editor/node_editor_window.py]

#### Dialog Architecture Patterns
- **Base Pattern**: Inherit from QDialog (established pattern in project)
- **Existing Examples**: SettingsDialog, EnvironmentManagerDialog, GraphPropertiesDialog
- **Layout**: Use QVBoxLayout and QHBoxLayout for responsive design
- **Integration**: Parent to main window for proper modal behavior
- **Resource Management**: Proper Qt object parenting for automatic cleanup
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#widget-structure, docs/architecture/source-tree.md#user-interface]

#### Data Models and UI Updates
- **Command Objects**: CommandBase instances with description and timestamp properties
- **History Access**: Access via NodeGraph.command_history.commands list
- **Real-time Updates**: Connect to existing command signals for automatic UI refresh
- **State Synchronization**: Use existing _update_undo_redo_actions() pattern for consistency
[Source: src/commands/command_base.py, src/commands/command_history.py]

#### Performance Considerations
- **UI Updates**: Limit history dialog to last 50 operations (existing max_depth)
- **Memory Usage**: Command history already managed within 50MB limit (NFR3)
- **Response Time**: UI updates must remain under 100ms for responsiveness (NFR1)
- **Large Histories**: Implement efficient list widget updates for smooth scrolling
[Source: docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements, src/commands/command_history.py]

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Fast execution (<5 seconds per test file) with deterministic behavior
- **GUI Testing**: Use existing test runner patterns for dialog and UI component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete undo/redo workflow including UI interactions
- **Edge Cases**: Empty history, maximum history, disabled states, composite operations
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

#### Technical Constraints
- **Windows Platform**: Use Windows-compatible commands and paths, no Unicode characters
- **PySide6 Framework**: Follow established Qt patterns and signal/slot connections
- **Existing Patterns**: Leverage established UI creation patterns and icon integration
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of command system failures with user feedback
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#prohibited-practices, CLAUDE.md]

### Testing

#### Test File Locations
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/test_undo_ui_integration.py` (new) - UI component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Extend existing `tests/test_command_system.py` for UI integration
- **GUI Tests**: Use existing test runner at `src/test_runner_gui.py` for user workflows
- **Test Naming**: Follow `test_{behavior}_when_{condition}` pattern
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

#### Testing Framework and Patterns
- **Framework**: Python unittest (established pattern in project)
- **Test Runner**: Custom PySide6 GUI test runner for interactive testing
- **Mocking**: Careful with PySide6 component mocking - consider QTest framework
- **Coverage**: Focus on UI state management, signal connections, and user workflows
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing-framework, docs/stories/2.2.story.md#lessons-learned]
